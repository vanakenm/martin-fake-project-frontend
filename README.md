# HYF Front End Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite and React Bootstrap package.

## Getting started

Do the backend installation first - https://github.com/vanakenm/hyf-backend-template if you did not do it already

- Create a repository based on this template: https://github.com/new?template_name=hyf-frontend-template&template_owner=vanakenm (once for the team)
- Clone your new repository locally (everyone)
- Run it:

    npm i
    npm run dev 

Go to localhost:5173.

If everything did go well, you should be able to select the "recipes" menu and see a list of three recipes.

That means you're all set to start working.

Don't hesitate to explore both repositories to see how they are organised
